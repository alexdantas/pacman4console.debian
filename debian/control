Description: console based pacman game
 This is a simple but very good pacman game. Also, its source code is very
 simple and well commented so it may be a good reference for learning ncurses
 and C programming.
 .
 Pacman4Console is an ASCII character based game. This game has nine levels.
 But you can make your own levels.
