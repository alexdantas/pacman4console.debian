.SH MAZE FILE LOCATION

.SH TIPS
.IP \(bu 3
The spawning wall is a wall that the ghosts can go through but Pacman
cannot. These can be used to make levels REALLY difficult. Check level 09.
.IP \(bu 3
Borders shouldn't need to be used, but give it a more Pacman-like feel.
If a ghost or Pacman are able to reach the very edge of the board, he will
be teleported to the opposite side of the level, both X and Y just like in
the regular game.
.IP \(bu 3
See any included level__.dat file for examples.
