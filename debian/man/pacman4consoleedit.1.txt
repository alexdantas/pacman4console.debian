MAZE FILE LOCATION

TIPS
   * The spawning wall is a wall that the ghosts can go through but Pacman
     cannot. These can be used to make levels REALLY difficult. Check level 09.

   * Borders shouldn't need to be used, but give it a more Pacman-like feel.
     If a ghost or Pacman are able to reach the very edge of the board, he will
     be teleported to the opposite side of the level, both X and Y just like in
     the regular game.

   * See any included level__.dat file for examples.
